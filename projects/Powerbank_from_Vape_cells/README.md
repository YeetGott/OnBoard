# Powerbank made out of old Vape batterycells

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
my PCB board connects the individual battery cells from empty vapes which I now want to use together as a power bank so the cells that would otherwise end up in the trash get a second life, for the sake of the environment
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The cost of the PCB at jlcpcb is €55.35 / $57.11
plus the cost of filament for the 3D printer and cables and a charging controller for the power bank, which is an additional €30 or so
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
